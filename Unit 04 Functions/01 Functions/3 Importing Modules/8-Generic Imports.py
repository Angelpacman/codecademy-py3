"""Generic Imports
Did you see that? Python said: NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined. Python doesn't know what square roots areâ€”yet.

There is a Python module named math that includes a number of useful variables and functions, and sqrt() is one of those functions. In order to access math, all you need is the import keyword. When you simply import a module this way, it's called a generic import."""


# Ask Python to print sqrt(25) on line 3.
import math
print (math.sqrt(25))
