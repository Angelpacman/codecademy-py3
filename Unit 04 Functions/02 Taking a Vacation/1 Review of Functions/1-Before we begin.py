"""Before We Begin
Let's first quickly review functions in Python.

def bigger(first, second):
  print max(first, second)
  return True
In the example above:

We define a function called bigger that has two arguments called first and second.
Then, we print out the larger of the two arguments using the built-in function max.
Finally, the bigger function returns True.
Now try creating a function yourself!
