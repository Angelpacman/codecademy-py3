"""Maintaining Order
Sometimes you need to search for an item in a list.

animals = ["ant", "bat", "cat"]
print animals.index("bat")
First, we create a list called animals with three strings.
Then, we print the first index that contains the string "bat", which will print 1.
We can also insert items into a list.

animals.insert(1, "dog")
print animals
We insert "dog" at index 1, which moves everything down by 1.
We print out ["ant", "dog", "bat", "cat"]"""

my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

for number in my_list:
    # Your code here
    print 2*number
